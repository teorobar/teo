# From what I understnad, JupyterLab is a more expansive but complicated version of Jupyter Notebook.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# ~/ is the root directory.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# An absolute path is the path all the way from the root to a directory.
# A relative path is the path from one directory to another.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute: C:/Users/Teo Robar/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
# Relative: ../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# Remove the contents of the directory

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add: adds files to the staging branch
# git commit: saves files in the staging branch to the local directory
# git push: saves files in the local directory to the remote directory

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add . will add all the files in the current directory.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# I accidentally used git add .. instead of git add . and had to figure out how to stop my computer from adding every file under my account in Users to the staging area.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# I think I'm following the class at the moment and don't have any major confusions.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# NASA is currently sending a probe to the Jovian moon Europa to investigate one of the most promising possible hubs for life in the solar system! (outside of Earth of course)
# The probe is called the Europa clipper and has tons of super interesting technology crammed into it for data collection including a mass spectrometer which they hope to fly through geysers to collect and analyze matter from Europa's sub-surface ocean!

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far.
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(25%9) # I like the % function, which gives the remainder of a whole number division, because it feels like such a complicated calculation for such a simple command.
